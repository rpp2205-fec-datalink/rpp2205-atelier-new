Atelier's New Website

# Accessibility

Online - Desktop/Mobile
Accessible through all Major Browsers (Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Edge)

# Usage

This Website is a gateway to the wonderful, high-quality products found at Atelier. By providing a dynamic graphic user experience, this website allows users/customers to explore the entire inventory of Atelier. Visual representations of different product styles, access to sizing information, a curated list of products related to the one you're viewing as well as an outfit builder to keep track of items that interest you most, are ALL at the click of your mouse.

# Improvements to be Made

At this point the site is fully functional and deployed! As Atelier knows, art is always a work in progress, and there are many ideas to be considered, features to be created, and further optimizations for speed and user experience. The addition of a Q/A sections as well as a more robust section for Reviews would be wonderful features to add!
